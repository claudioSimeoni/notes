*Problem about GCD*

Such a nice problem, given a range you need to find a pair a, b, where both of them lie in the original interval and they have gcd g.
In particular you want to find a couple a : b-a is maximal and between these couple you have to chose the one with minumum a. 

-KEY IDEA-
Now the fact is that basically you can say that thanks to the density of primes there will be a prime every ~logl with l being the right
extreme of the interval, so you can lineary check the couples in order and the expected complexity will be quite low.

Another interesting thing that lies behind the well known 1/logn desity of primes is that it is an approximation of *productory(1-1/p)*
that actually means the probability that a number is not divisible for each prime before n.
