*Fix Flooded Floor*

-Tip- When you need to do a dp in a grid such as this one on a few layers you should consider to go one column at a time. 
                                                                                                                        ##..#.##..
                                                                                                                        #.......##

*Counting Towers* 

This is such a great dp problem, it shows how dp is actually just recursion, you need to choose properly what to recurr on.
